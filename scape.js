Between 3,000-4,000 years ago

3rd age = the god wars is over. People set up temples to the gods who fought. The 3 main surviving gods are Zamarack, Saradonium and Guthix.  
Around 2,000 years ago 
  
4th age= civilization is destroyed by fighting over gods and people are nomadic. Humans fight with monsters over land. Humans try to re-establish land and gods again.

Late 4th age= humans begin to spread out over the map.
Around a few hundred years ago

Early 5th age= humans find Guthix’s rune essence and begin to create the human kingdoms.

Late 5th age= close to time of present humans are driving out the Zaros and Saradomists monsters by uniting and also fighting each other for power over the runes.  

Late 5th age= fighting over rune essence power still remains.






Metals: Weaponology (Value increases going down)
Bronze: consists of about 88% copper and 12% tin. A ductile metal that was originally harder than iron while iron was being badly refined. Does not oxidize. 
Strength: ++

Iron: Oxidizes, giving a black tarnished outer surface when refined. Refining an iron deposit and separating it from the common minerals around it like nickel. Iron refining requires a blast furnace unlike bronze. 
Strength: ++++

Silver: lower oxidation properties than bronze. Very low caustic (does not get absorbed by plasma in the blood). Lower strength than bronze but can be molded and sharpened to be sharper than iron. 
Strength: +

Steel: Very high strength compared to pure Iron. Steel is typically 2% carbon and 98% iron. Steel takes a long time to produce and needs a blast furnace. 
Strength: ++++++++

Gold: A precious metal found in the crust. The most malleable and moldable metal on Earth.  The most noble of the noble metals (oxidation resistant). Mined from Electrum (an ore containing 20% silver and 80% gold).
Alchemy and Chemistry studied gold in medieval times to do its high preservation values, which also lead to it being used as a universal currency.
Strength: +++++

Mithril: A magical form of silver with a bluish tint to it, possibly meaning it has lower oxidation values than silver. It is also stronger and lighter than steel; equivalent to modern day titanium alloys. 
Strength: ++++++++++++

Adamantium: Very unique and rare stone. A type of diamond that can be molded into a form. In addition to its hardness it has magnetic properties and can absorb almost any physical energy, making the metal itself when refined indestructible. 
Strength: ++++++++++++++++++++

Rune: A stone with an inscription on it from the 1st age. The stone and the inscription are from the gods. The stone itself is completely impregnable because it’s not found on Earth and has other worldly magical properties and strength.   
Strength: ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Dragon Stone/Gems/elf crystals:  Not found naturally on Earth or deposited from the 1st age. It’s a mineral that was left behind after the god wars by the gods themselves. No tool can mold it, 
however dragon tips can be made from a gem with superior crafting skills as well as other very rare gems left by the gods.
Dragon Armor and Weapons cannot be made so the few that exist from the god wars given to mortals to fight are extremely expensive in the 5th age. Elf crystals are gems given to the elven race by a god working for saradonian.   
Strength: ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  
 
God weapons: Either priceless staffs that cannot be sold or bought. Or Weapons and armor used only by the god’s themselves and their celestial armies. Not only can they not be made by mortals. Their rarity is legendary and their value astronomical.
Only the most powerful can even wield such weapons, in which they themselves are designed to destroy the very creations made by the gods. 
Strength: ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 



Magical Material: Magic ology increasing value going down
Wizard: material from the second age. Worn by the common mortal, and valued high in the 5th age.

Wood Material: Tree Ology increasing going down
 Evergreen/common tree: Found commonly all over the map. Except for desserts. The tree has been around only in the 5th age, and is used from construction to weaponry. 
Resilience: 
+++++
Oak/dense wooded areas: From the 4th age originally. This somewhat uncommon wood is found in dense wooded areas. The tree was spawned when humans stopped using trees as much after the god wars, because most were nomadic tribes. However going into the 5th age, this tree was used up by rising cities when they found its superior resilience to the common tree, which was sickly compared to the Oak and dense wooded areas. 
Resilience:
+++++++++++++++
   Willow/ Teak/ Maple/ very dense: These trees are originally from the 3rd age. Spawned out of the devotion to the gods for elemental resources. Guthix (god of nature), spawned the Willow tree for a watery resource, Teak for a resource in humid lands and Maple for a very cold and dry resource.
Resilience:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Yew / Mahogany/ Arctic Pine: From the beginning of the 3rd age immediately after the god wars ended. Guthix made the three woods in order to strive peace between the creations. Yew for wooded areas, Mahogany for hot and humid areas and Arctic Pine for cold regions. However war soon started up again, so Guthix spawned the much lesser trees instead Willow, Teak and Maple. 
Resilience:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 
Magic/ Red Wood: Spawned in the 1st age by Guthix as a prized wood. Most of the trees were burned in the 2nd age by the god wars, and are only kept alive by magical preserved areas around the map. Much lesser trees were spawned by Guthix in the 3rd, 4th and 5th age.  
Resilience:
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  

Crafting: Runes
All from the essence, from the 1st age by Guthix. 


Elemental: 
Air: The air element is used to describe unpredictable behavior. It’s relatively weak compared to the other elemental runes. The rune is the essence of speed, change, emotional and passive.
Water: The Water element describes powerful determination. It’s much stronger then air. The rune is the essence of power, logic, steadiness and order.
Earth: The Earth element describes Strength. It’s much stonger than water. The Rune is the essence of strength, reality, relationships and wit.
Fire: The Fire Element describes Force: It’s much stronger than Earth. The rune is the essence of power, aggression, rage and piety.   


Offensive:
Mind: The mind rune is the essence of a human mind (or a human spirit). Every human has a unique spirit and stone holds the essence of the spirit. The human mind is a celestial part of a human with the human brain being moral and down to Earth. A mind rune stone can be combined with an elemental stone to cause a spiritual force on the element.
1 mind rune unit 
Chaos: The chaos rune builds off of the mind rune. Chaos is the essence of multiple minds infused into one stone. Chaos is then very unpredictable and violent. The result is a very angry spiritual force that can be combined with an elemental rune.  
10 mru – 1 cru
Death: The death rune builds off of the chaos rune. It’s from multiple chaos stones infusing into one death rune stone. The death rune then becomes the essence of dread and overwhelming chaos. This is a very powerful force and is deadly when combined with an elemental rune stone.
100 mru -10 cru- 1 dru
Blood: The blood rune is from infusing multiple death runes. It’s a very, very powerful rune stone. It’s the essence of life itself, thus becoming the force to end it as well.

1,000 mru - 100 cru-  10 dru- 1 bru 
Wrath: The wrath rune is from infusing multiple blood runes. It’s the max charge of any rune stone holding thousands of human spirits in it. Only a master can use such a stone. It is the essence of a spiritual army. There is very little defense for any being when up against a wrath rune stone. The wrath rune stone when combined with an elemental rune stone becomes an unstoppable force of spiritual power. 
 1 wru- 10 bru- 100 dru- 1,000 cru- 10,000 mru
