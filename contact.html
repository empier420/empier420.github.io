    <h1><bold>TITLE: MURDER MYSTERY BOUNDS</bold></h1>
    <h3>Chapter 1:The Start</h3>
    <p>  “Look James, it’s over we have all of evidence and it wasn’t easy either.<br> We have the lightly irradiated murder weapon, the blood matches and even the suspect admits to the killing.”<br>
  James is standing in front of the large one way mirror leading into the interrogation<br> room where the suspect is. He seems adamant that something is wrong.<br>
  “You’re wrong about this case Hector. I have been going through this case over and over again. <br>I’ve taken numerous notes and spoken to many key contributors to our suspect’s routine movements.<br>
      And the conclusion that I can make from all of this is that he’s lying when he says he killed Patricia.<br> This man, he wouldn’t kill to get money; it just isn’t him.”<br>
  Hector now stands up facing James as if he had just lost a bet and was defeated. <br>
  “I’ll trust you based on your 100% record of leading murder cases. But count me out on this one.<br> My gut tells me that your suspect won’t move on the fact that he killed Patricia for the will of money.”<br>
  James walks into the interrogation room with the suspect Mr. Kyle Teller in the seat with his head on the table sobbing.<br> He looks as if he knows it’s all over and there’s nothing anyone can do for him.<br>
      James sits in the seat opposite the seat to Kyle and he picks his head up to look at James.<br>
  “So, Mr. Teller; they tell me you have made a confession with detective Hector at around noon today. Is that correct Mr. Teller?”<br>
  Kyle just nods his head slowly in James’s direction while continuing to sob. James starring back at Kyle with a sharp look of suspicion.<br> 
  “Well, I would just like to know Mr. Teller how you feel about lying like that?” <br>
  Kyle looked at James with a look of confusion and curiosity. He wasn’t sure what James meant by the statement.<br> However he also didn’t know what was now going on with his situation.<br>
  “Lying? Detective?”<br>
  “Why, yes indeed Mr. Teller. You are indeed lying to us all.”<br>
  Kyle was now no longer sobbing and looked very confused with the exchange, “detective you have caught me with all of my evidence.<br> There isn’t much more for me to say.”<br>
  James stands up from his seat and slams his hand on the desk in front of Kyle making a loud thump in the room. He then stares at Kyle.<br>
  “Come with me, won’t you?”<br><br><br>
    They arrive at the scene of the crime with Kyle in handcuffs riding in the backseat of an unmarked police car. <br>Hector is sitting shotgun as he re-tells the evidence and the scenario to James,<br>
      because he can’t believe he is going back to the scene of the crime.<br>
  “Man breaks into bank at 5:00 AM captured on film as wearing a black hoodie and holding a bar machine gun and wielding a backpack.<br> At 5:01 AM all video feeds are cut from machine gun fire, but audio is<br>
      still working from one security device. At 5:05 AM many explosions are heard and outside witnesses confirm fire from the bank.<br> At 5:10 AM audio picks up a male voice talking about how his weapon keeps <br>
      jamming because it was buried for a month in a deep hole with radon exposure. Then at 5:15 AM the screams of the victim now known<br> as Patricia Jones was heard yelling help as the suspect was now found out to be strangling the victim.<br>
      Afterwards the police show up at 5:25 AM and observe the inside of the bank destroyed and on fire,<br> a woman with a lacerated neck lying dead just outside the bank and some loose change all over the floor.”<br>
      James looks over at the bank as they arrive.<br></p>
    <h3> Chapter 2:The Meeting</h3>
    <p>  Kyle comes out of the car reluctantly and enters the bank with the other two detectives. There is <br>yellow tape and evidence markers scattered all over the floor. A few crime scene <br>investigators are in the bank having a lunch break as they eat and drink over the counter. <br>They look up as James and Hector enter with Kyle in handcuffs. James walks over to the crime scene investigator crew.<br>
  “You can leave now guys, thank you for holding down the area.”<br>
  The crew slowly get up and leave. They worked long hours cleaning up and gathering evidence <br>for the detectives. 
  As they leave Hector turns to James.<br>
  “OK. So now what? What are we looking for James?”<br>
  James calmly walks over to the counter and brushes off a few dust particles from the surface. <br>Then he opens his journal and looks at his notes.<br>
  “It doesn’t make sense Mr. Teller. There’s no money taken from the bank. Just destruction and<br> a murder. And for what?”<br>
    Kyle is silent as he stands handcuffed studying the detectives. <br>
  “We know you didn’t know the victim Patricia Jones. We know it’s you on the camera. And we <br>found all of your weapons in your possession when we raided your house.”<br>
  Kyle was still silent.<br>
  James walks over to Kyle, leaving his journal on the counter. Hector stares suspiciously as <br>James approaches Kyle. Then without warning James punches Kyle in the stomach hard. <br>Kyle falls over as Hector tries to stop James by pulling his back.<br>
  “James what are you doing!!!!!!!?”<br>
  “He’s holding out on a secret. I just don’t know what it is, and I don’t think he will tell us by <br>just walking him around.”<br>
    Hector quickly runs over to Kyle to guard him in case he tries to run away.<br>
  “Look James. It has to be him, he knows no one else. And if anything he did commit many <br>crimes without even murdering Patricia.”<br>
  James regains his composure and goes back to his journal.<br>
  “Yes, but Patricia was a somebody. She was the Mayor, and a very wealthy one too. Something <br>doesn’t add up. I have it down that she walks along this bank every Saturday, leaving her <br>house at around 5:00 AM. And we have no confirmation that Mr. Teller killed anyone.”<br>
  “So, what then? You think he was a diversion. But then who gains from her death. She has no <br>family and no will to anyone.”<br>
  “I don’t think it was for money. That’s why I’m at a loss. But I know it wasn’t out of shock or a <br>type of psychotic behavior. She was definitely murdered in cold blood. And he knows <br>why.”<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Chapter 3: The Interrogation</h3>
    <p> The room is quiet as James looks around the room examining every corner with focus. After a <br>while he looks at Kyle who is being guarded by Hector.<br>
  “Mr. Teller. I didn’t bring you here just to talk. It’s time to get to business. There’s no cameras <br>here and this place will be closed off for a weak.”<br>
  James takes Kyle out from under Hector’s hold and uses more pairs of handcuffs to handcuff <br>Kyle’s arms and legs to the chair. Hector looks on stunned by what James is doing.<br>
  “James? What do you think you are doing? He’s in our custody as a suspect. He’s not a POW, I <br>mean this is crazy.”<br>
  After restraining James to the chair Kyle looks at a still surprised Hector.<br>
  “You think this is crazy? I’ll tell you what’s crazy………. That this person here was hired by a <br>hitman to act as a diversion while he stole something important held by Patricia.”<br>
  With that said, James saw a sudden movement in Kyle’s facial movements that he only <br>recognized because of decades in interrogation experience.<br>
  “Well, well, well, would you look at that?”<br>
  Kyle smiled and looked at Hector who knew by James’s look that he found something. Hector <br>has worked with James for 30 years and he knew just by James’s look if he found <br>something or not.<br>
  “What did you find James?”<br>
  “I found out that Mr. Teller was used in an act of diversion. Patricia must have been wearing <br>her headphones when she came around the corner. Then the second man came out and <br>stabbed her. She must have lost something when she was murdered, or so I think.”<br>
  James starred at Kyle and got another slight twitch around the eyes. <br>
  “So, Mr. Teller where is that information? I have been doing this job for over 30 years and<br> found one thing to be a constant; your eyes are the one thing on your face that never lie.”<br>
  Kyle spoke to try and make his case, not sure what James found out by reading his face.<br>
  “I didn’t know about Patricia that’s the truth. I came in and destroyed the place, to lower the <br>value of a property tax for a business across the street; that’s the truth.”<br>
  James studied the man………..and after a while looked out across the street from the window <br>and found a small helmet repair shop with a sign that read they would repair all work and <br>recreational helmets for (1/10) the retail price of the helmet. He then looked back at Kyle who was still giving no signs of a lie.<br>
  “Wait here Mr. Teller,” James said jokingly.<br>
  James convened with Hector who was guarding the front door.<br>
  “Well, what do you think James?”<br>
  “Hector, I think he’s telling the truth here. He looks honestly scarred bout the damage around <br>this place yet at a loss about the victim…….. Was there any fingerprints or blood on the <br>victim’s body.”<br>
  Hector sighed, “Yes and yes; all which belong to Kyle Teller. In addition to bullet casings and a<br> bullet matching the gun he was using found in her foot.”<br>
  “Any knife found from the stabbing?”<br>
  “No, but James that could be easily disposed of.”<br>
  “And the gun was found in the suspect’s custody?”<br>
  “Yes, at his hideout.”<br>
  “Thank you……….ok I know what to do now.”<br>
  James went back over to Kyle and stood in front of him. Kyle was sobbing again as he sat there <br>like the first time he interrogated him.<br>
  “Mr. Teller if you are indeed innocent of murder here, the evidence sure is making your case <br>hard to defend………Any particular reason anyone would want to frame you. Like for <br>example, were you told to destroy this place by anyone?”<br>
  James studied Kyle’s face but he knew James’ game now so he looked as angry as possible, <br>which was the only way to mask the expression of his eyes. James was impressed by his<br> ingenuity.<br>
  “My. Teller. You seem to be a very inquisitive gentleman……….and not a killer.”<br>
  “I am not a killer detective.”<br>
    </p>
    <h3>chapter 4: The Truth Hurts</h3>
      <p>
        “So, then what are you Mr. Teller. A raging angry maniac that destroys property because you don’t <br> get your way? Or are you a person that lies?”<br>
  Kyle looked up at James still sobbing and looking defeated.<br>
  “…….They made me do it, ok. It wasn’t my fault,, they pushed me to do it.”<br>
  James looked at Hector who had come over behind Kyle to witness the confession.<br>
“Why?” Hector said as he got even closer to him, ready for anything that Kyle might try. <br>
  “…………….Because, they have me in chains.” <br>
  James looked at Hector with confusion, back at the store, then back at Kyle.<br>
  “Chains? You mean they threatened to destroy your store.”<br>
Kyle looked on as if he was on trial admitting to a deep secret. Sweat was beginning to drip <br>down his face and he was getting more and more faint by the second.<br>
  “Ye……..ye……….yes……and my family, all my wealth, all of it they threatened to destroy <br>everything………… They are my boss’s to a company that promised me millions of dollars <br>in cash if I did everything they told me to do, working as an over seer at the helmet <br>shop………..I told lies to people and set up meeting points so they could commit many <br>murders……….I’m……..I’m just a pawn detective.”<br>
  “No.” Hector said in a demanding way. “This can’t be true, you were there and we have <br>evidence. You had to of have killed Patricia!”<br>
  James looked at Hector. <br>
  “Hector. He’s not our enemy here. He is a criminal but he’s not the big fish………… What<br> we’re going to do is wire the suspect and send him out to the wolves. That way <br>we……..”<br>
  “NOOO!!!! Please wait stop.“ Kyle shouted, “I’m already wired even now as we speak. I have<br> audio implants hidden inside me.” <br>  
  A chill ran up James’ spine. He saw an object come crashing through the window like a rock.<br> The object then rolled across the floor behind Hector who had just turned around.<br> Hector looked at it then back at James with terror. With that cue James sprinted away in an <br> instant. The grenade exploded just as James started to run. The heat and shrapnel tore into his left <br>arm as he used it to get behind the counter in milliseconds before the grenade went off. He <br>then fell back from the concussion of the explosion and it knocked the wind out of him.<br>
 James was 10 minutes later sprawled out on the ground gasping for air. Just then he heard <br>footsteps and crushing of glass from beyond the counter. He tried to stay as still as possible.<br> He didn’t have any weapon on him or any communication device. But he knew <br>someone would have called the police, but his gut was telling him to stay quiet. <br>
  The unknown footsteps walked very slowly under the crushed glass. The person, who was a <br> woman then spoke. “Looks like you won’t be needing your money after all. Oh, what’s <br> this, two birds with one stone. Now that’s how you save………..Let’s see here.” The <br> woman seemed to be dialing on a phone. “Hi Con, no the third man got away. He must have got <br> away. I know I have to get out, I just needed to grab the audio evidence, you don’t want <br>that to be used in court do you? Yea, that’s what I thought. Just keep your eyes peeled on <br>the street he’s got to be injured severely maybe we can pick him off before the cops pick <br>him up.”<br>
  After the phone call the footsteps left in a hurry, in then James blacked out from blood loss. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>Chapter 5: Not Bulletproof</h3>
    <p>
      “……..What?............Where am I?”<br>
  James opens his eyes up sleepily to find out that he’s on a bed in a room full of lights. He <br>squints from all of the light. <br>
  “Doctor, he’s awake. Look he’s moving his head.”<br>
  James realized he must be in some type of intensive care unit. And he was out for some time.<br>
  “James? Can you hear me?”<br>
  James turned his head and forced his eyes open. He saw his sister looking at him next to his <br>raised bed. She was a doctor at a hospital so she was wearing her doctor’s coat while being <br>on duty from another hospital across town. James saw that her face had a look of concern <br>and her eyes looked tired, like she was thinking about something that she couldn’t come to <br>terms with. <br>
  James then turned his head to look down the bed. What he found was that his entire left arm<br> was completely gone. And parts of his body were covered in gauze. As he tried to move <br>he felt an enormous amount of pain ripple up his spine from all over his body. He couldn’t<br> help but scream and then cry from the pain.<br>
  “Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!! What happened to me???!!!!! Somebody help!!!!!!!!”<br>
  The doctor rushed by James’s side do deliver an injection of morphine. His sister stepped back<br> wide eyed from the bed. She was in complete shock over everything that had just <br>recently happened.<br>
  As the doctor gave James the morphine, and his pain slowly faded; James looked at him in a<br> very curious and confused way.<br> 
  “Doctor, what’s going on? I have been shot in the gut a few times in my life. But this pain is<br> probably 100 times worse.”<br>
  The old doctor, who looked tired and exhausted looked at James solemnly to address the <br>question.<br>
  “Sur, I’m Doctor Vick and I’m the explosive trauma expert in the region. You were struck by a:<br> high radical lead fragmentation grenade. This is a very expensive explosive and is usually <br>used in the black market by a big ticket hitman…………. I’m afraid the hot lead broke into<br> your skin in multiple areas leaving behind very tricky scarring. Hot lead doesn’t just <br>rip, it leaves traces amount of lead fragments leaving severe lead poising in your system,<br> also known as a free radical overflow………. I’m sorry but your arm had to be <br>amputated immediately, it was completely poisoned and the free radicals were spreading<br> throughout the rest of your body……….. I’m also sorry but…… from all of the <br>scans that we have it seems as though……….your entire nervous system had been<br> compromised. In order to save your life, we had to break the some of the axon bundles in your <br>brain…………. You were minutes away from death, sur……… I’m so sorry, yet glad <br>you’re are alive.” <br>
  James read the doctors eyes like a pamphlet. He knew that he would never walk again. He also <br>knew that most of his muscle connections bellow the neck were now completely gone.<br> James was now remembering what he was doing before the grenade went off. So he asked the<br> question.<br>
  “Vick, did they die quickly? With little pain?”<br>
  Vick just nodded his head. In then left the room expecting that James now wanted some alone time <br>with his family. <br>
  After the doctor shut the door his sister came beside his bead again. Only this time she had <br> obviously just been sobbing. She really didn’t know what she could say at the moment. So she <br> put her hand on his one still existing hand and tried her best. <br>
  “James, I remember when you were 13 years old, and I was 18. We were in a hardware store <br> shopping for a father’s day present…… In then you bet me the price of the gift that you <br> could convince the store workers to lower the price of the leaf blower just by reading their <br> eyes and being very careful in your speech. I thought that you wouldn’t even try so I took <br> you up on it…… And as you know, you ended up figuring out every sensitive relationship <br> in the store between the workers…….in then after the manager knew that you knew he was <br> flirting with a minor, so he just gave it to us for free. James you were always a first class <br> de…” <br>
  James interrupted, more annoyed by the attempts to distract him than feeling relief from the <br> pain. <br>
  “Heather! Just stop……You can go home to your family if you want. You don’t need to be <br> here…..And don’t bring anyone here. Not your husband or you’re the kids in tow. Please I <br>  just need to get back to work. Please just leave.” <br>
  With that Heather lost it and started crying hard. She turned her head so that James couldn’t see <br> her face, because she knew that for him he could get more information out of her by the <br> way she cried than if she sat down and talked with him for an hour. <br>
   After a while with her gaze still facing the door she decided to tell her brother what she found <br> out earlier. “James, the chief pulled you from all duty because of your injuries and put you <br> on lifetime pay because of your service. I told him that pulling you would do more harm <br> than good because you live to work. But he wouldn’t listen to me. As for your case, it <br> seems that the killer……that uh killed, I guess your other suspect, and Hector.... Oh, James I am <br> so sorry about Hector…..” <br>
  After speaking about the case and all of the destruction and death. Heather couldn’t take it and <br>went for the door. But James quickly called for her.<br>
  “Heather, Wait! Please just tell me what the captain said about the killer.” <br>
  Heather decided for the sake of her brother she would continue, and speak to him properly. She <br> turned to face him still sobbing and continued. <br>
  “After the explosion….. The first responder unit arrived at the scene in 15 minutes, because <br> there was no calls, they just went on where they heard the explosion. Afterwards the crime <br> scene investigators did another search. And they found an unidentified male body next to the bank. After an <br> extensive ID search they found the body belonged to Connor Grit; he was the owner of a <br> helmet shop across the street from the bank……He was killed with a gunshot to the head. <br> Not from any weapon in police custody. OK James, now is that enough murder for one <br> day?” <br>
  James looked at her and he knew that she was mentally finished with this case. And that she <br> didn’t want to mention the case ever again. James knew she was no detective. <br>
  “Thank you Heather for everything. And I’m sorry I was rood earlier…….. Heather this is <br> important though. I need you to call the captain and put him on speaker. I need to speak to him.” <br>
 Heather reluctantly dialed his cell phone number and put it on speaker. <br>
  “Hello, Captain Wade?” <br>
  “James? You’re awake! It’s good to hear from you.”<br>
  “Captain you must listen. I was still conscious moments after the grenade explosion. There <br> was a woman inside the bank. She yanked an audio device from a body cavity inside Mr. <br> Teller. She had Mr. Teller wired so she could spy on us during interrogation. Our original <br> suspect was a Trojan horse to get information about our office, probably to sell the <br> information. When I brought him back to the bank, I was just playing the part to her whole plan. <br> You see I heard her call someone she called Con on the phone to discuss plans about <br> getting an audio device from Mr. Teller before the police got a hold of it. That must be Connor <br> Grit. She must have killed Connor after she killed Mr. Teller to retrieve a second audio <br> device. I think they were both being used; Connor for killing Patricia and Mr.<br> Teller for destroying the bank. With audio devices attached, she could use the <br>information as evidence for a murder trial in another circuit after this all blows over.”<br>
  “James, but why would she do all of this? And if this is all true than who is this woman?”<br>
                     
   “I told you, for money…… Let me guess, the helmet shop was destroyed moments after you <br> left the scene.” <br>
  “OK, how did you know that? We have been trying to keep that covered for public safety.”<br>
  “She must be trying to get the insurance……commercial insurance companies to combat the police <br> department. If she does that then she can release the audio for the insurance company to <br> buy. And they would use it in court to convict the now dead suspects of the crime. But now <br> that they are dead, the state department would end up paying all of the damages. Which<br> ends up being millions in her pocket.”<br>
  “James, this is a very big hunch! I’m listening though, because you’re almost never <br> wrong…….<sigh>……. OK, what should I do then?”  <br>
  “You need to confiscate the phone of the woman who contacts LAND MARKERS, that’s the <br> name of the insurance company in contract for that block. It won’t be easy, you will need to <br> contact the company before-hand or else you will miss your chance, because she will<br> definitely call it in with people on the inside. Actually…..scratch that….. just go straight to the<br> CEO immediately to get every employees’ phone tapped to record the deal, you must <br> move quickly captain.” <br>
  “I hope you know what you’re talking about James….. I’ll come meet you soon. I want to have<br> a long conversation about my decision on your employment.” <br>
  “Just move quickly Captain. She has probably stolen Patricia’s passcodes for entering the cities<br> circuit laws and commercial insurance transactions as well. That’s probably<br> why she killed Patricia. Patricia never left home without them sealed and attached <br>to her. PLEASE hurry captain!<br>
