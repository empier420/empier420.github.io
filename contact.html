    <h3>Chapter 1:The Start</h3>
    <p>  “Look James, it’s over we have all of evidence and it wasn’t easy either. We have the lightly irradiated murder weapon, the blood matches and even the suspect admits to the killing.”<br>
  James is standing in front of the large one way mirror leading into the interrogation room where the suspect is. He seems adamant that something is wrong.<br>
  “You’re wrong about this case Hector. I have been going through this case over and over again. I’ve taken numerous notes and spoken to many key contributors to our suspect’s routine movements.<br>
      And the conclusion that I can make from all of this is that he’s lying when he says he killed Patricia. This man, he wouldn’t kill to get money; it just isn’t him.”<br>
  Hector now stands up facing James as if he had just lost a bet and was defeated. <br>
  “I’ll trust you based on your 100% record of leading murder cases. But count me out on this one. My gut tells me that your suspect won’t move on the fact that he killed Patricia for the will money.”<br>
  James walks into the interrogation room with the suspect Mr. Kyle Teller in the seat with his head on the table sobbing. He looks as if he knows it’s all over and there’s nothing anyone can do for him.<br>
      James sits in the seat opposite the seat to Kyle and he picks his head up to look at James.<br>
  “So, Mr. Teller; they tell me you have made a confession with detective Hector at around noon today. Is that correct Mr. Teller?”<br>
  Kyle just nods his head slowly in James’s direction while continuing to sob. James starring back at Kyle with a sharp look of suspicion.<br> 
  “Well, I would just like to know Mr. Teller how you feel about lying like that?” <br>
  Kyle looked at James with a look of confusion and curiosity. He wasn’t sure what James meant by the statement. However he also didn’t know what was now going on with his situation.<br>
  “Lying? Detective?”<br>
  “Why, yes indeed Mr. Teller. You are indeed lying to us all.”<br>
  Kyle was now no longer sobbing and looked very confused with the exchange, “detective you have caught me with all of my evidence. There isn’t much more for me to say.”<br>
  James stands up from his seat and slams his hand on the desk in front of Kyle making a loud thump in the room. He then stares at Kyle.<br>
  “Come with me, won’t you?”
    They arrive at the scene of the crime with Kyle in handcuffs riding in the backseat of an unmarked police car. Hector is sitting shotgun as he re-tells the evidence and the scenario to James,<br>
      because he can’t believe he is going back to the scene of the crime.<br>
  “Man breaks into bank at 5:00 AM captured on film as wearing a black hoodie and holding a bar machine gun and wielding a backpack. At 5:01 AM all video feeds are cut from machine gun fire, but audio is<br>
      still working from one security device. At 5:05 AM many explosions are heard and outside witnesses confirm fire from the bank. At 5:10 AM audio picks up a male voice talking about how his weapon keeps <br>
      jamming because it was buried for a month in a deep hole with radon exposure. Then at 5:15 AM the screams of the victim now known as Patricia Jones was heard yelling help at the suspect was now found out to be strangling the victim.<br>
      Afterwards the police show up at 5:25 AM and observe the inside of the bank destroyed and on fire, a woman with a lacerated neck lying dead just outside the bank and some loose change all over the floor.”<br>
      James looks over at the bank as they arrive.<br></p>
