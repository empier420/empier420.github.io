<h1>Title: Vast Score Novel</h1>
<p>
A man has woken up to a very unusual scene. He wakes up lying in sand. He realizes he is not in his bed, he’s on some sort of beach. <br>
  ‘What? What happened to me?’ <br>
  He’s lost and the sun beats down on him making him very unconfutable. He starts to panic from all of his senses starting to go off like warning bells.<br>
   “Help, somebody I have been kidnapped!”<br>
  A large object approaches from some tropical trees near by………..”AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,” It’s a giant spider 5 feet across. The man finds strength he never knew he had and sprints for his life towards the shore. He realizes just over a sand dune is some sort of primitive village with mud for construction. It looked like from the Stone Age, but he could see fires scattered along with the mud huts that seemed to hug the sea. <br>
  “Help somebody, I’m coming in.” <br>
  He felt a gust of wind and a spray from behind him. He turned to see the spider a couple of inches from him now falling back with a huge 3 foot stone tipped harpoon sticking from his eyes. <br><br><br>
 
  “Who are you people, and why am I here?”<br>
  The man was now sitting down at a camp with a fire nearby as tribal looking men and women starred at him from a warry distance.  They had on snakeskins for clothing and had giant spider fangs as their headdress. <br>
  One tribal man with lots of fangs on his headdress came forward with a stone spear. He spoke, “Where did you come from? And what’s your name?”<br>
  The man looked startled that he spoke his language and was addressing him in a friendly manner. “My name is Samuel and I woke up like this, I don’t know where I am; can you tell me where I am?”<br>
  The tribal man looked puzzled, he walked back to his congregation to discuss some things then came back to Sam moments later. He had a strange look on his face like he was working something out. “You’re not from here?”<br>
  Sam looked up at him still sitting by the fire, “No, I’m from Miami Florida. Where am I now?”<br>
  The tribal man looked up at the sky and raised his spear towards the sun which was in the center of the sky beating down on the hot sand. “This is star land, this is the bottom of the world. Our world is the Vast Score World; it means many ways.”<br>
  “I don’t understand.”<br>
  “You are very lost, we can tell by clothing. Maybe someone at star set land can help you. But here there is no one.” The man began to walk off.<br>
  “Wait. How do I get there?”<br>
  The crowd of tribal men and women began to laugh. They looked at each other and talked as if what Sam said was hysterical. <br>
  The tribal man with the huge headdress turned and said, “You must take one of our boats and try to get picked up by one of their boats, there is no other way. Sunset land is full of giant flying monsters and stormy weather all at near darkness, that’s why we don’t go there. But they have knowledge and skill beyond us, they might be able to help you.” <br>

  As Sam was getting his boat and supplies he realized that it was till noon by the position of the sun and he was starting to get sunburn.<br>
  “Wow I can’t believe how hot it is here, and how slow the time goes by.”<br>
  The tribal man who was helping Sam looked at him looking very amused.<br>
  “You are funny. It has been a full wake cycle since you have been here, you should get some rest and get a sleep cycle in before your grand journey.”<br>
  Sam was shown an animal skinned tent where he could sleep. It was a tent with only a wooden frame and cotton for bedding. Sam laid down and realized he was very tired. It wasn’t long before he was asleep.<br><br><br>

  Sam woke up to a tribal woman starring at him. <br>
“He’s awake, can I come with him now!”<br>
  Sam got to his feet. And exited the tent where there was a small gathering. <br>
  “Yes, he needs a guide there. Here take torch and water for long journey. You must be part of this man’s life now, come.”<br>
  Sam looked confused as he was pushed from behind toward the woman by the tribal man with all of the fangs. He was placed next to the women and another tribal man with giant spider eyes on his head like a hat spoke. <br>
  “Do you both agree to protect each other for better or for worse? And to love each other until death.”<br>
  The woman said yes. And before Sam could object, realizing what was going on she kissed him hard and their union was made. <br><br><br>

  Sam was now off in a canoe boat with his new surprise wife who he had never met, but was now married to, do to an unforeseen culture shock experience. The woman’s name he learned was High Crawl, meaning fearless. She had long hair and dark brown skin like all of the tribal people. <br>
  As they moved farther and farther out the sun was starting to get lower and lower. Sam had just now realized that the sun wasn’t moving here and that it must be much closer to the planet or wherever he thought he was now. It was starting to actually get cold which at first was a relief from the scorched sandy area that he was at previously. <br>
  High Crawl had brought spider hair blankets with her and put some on Sam, seeing that he was starting to shiver. <br>
  “Oh, thank you……………..The uh…………..the star, it doesn’t move does it.”<br>
  High Crawl looked at Sam, perplexed; “I guess not. All we ever know is the star. We never come out here unless for dire need of resources from the star set people.”<br>
  Hours pass by sailing, the wind picked up to large dangerous gusts. The temperature must have dropped to below freezing because of how frigid it felt. Sam and High Crawl had to huddle up in the small boat under layers of spider fur to try not to freeze to death. Everything Sam touched felt like plastic, he knew he was in big trouble. The sun was just above the horizon now dimly lighting the way ahead.<br>
  “High Crawl!? I think I’m dying, I don’t think I’m going to make it to wherever were going.”<br>
  “Hold on Sam!!!!” High Crawl reached over to the inside of the boat to take out a torch. She fiddled with the torch with some materials in the corner in then it was lit. She then wedged the torch into a long stick that Sam thought was there as a bench and raised the torch 10 feet high.<br>
  She stuck the pole into a wooden stand on the boat in then furiously tried to warm Sam up with more spider hairs and rubbing his chest. But it was no Good, Sam fell asleep. <br><br><br>  
     Sam woke up to a loud and piercing wind. As he opened his eyes he realized he was somewhere very different now. He was inside a large building, not a hut. He looked around to see wooden carving of sea monsters and warriors carved into the walls and ceilings. He was on some sort of cotton bedding next to a stone fireplace. <br>
    He saw a man coming into the doorway of the room he was with High Crawl being pushed in front of him shackled up in chains. The man had on steel plated armor and had a menacing looking sword with a serrated edge holstered on his back. From the eye slits of him helmet he could see that these people had very pale skin compared to the star land people. They were also very big at least 2 feet taller than High Crawl who was bigger than Sam by about a foot and Sam was 6 feet. They also looked like that had a lot of muscle underneath their armor as well.<br>
  The man threw High Crawl unto the floor and removed his helmet. Sam was shocked to see that unlike the star land people he didn’t look human at all. He had 4 eyes in a diamond patter at the edges of his face. His skin wasn’t just pail, it was slimy looking like a fish. His mouth was in the middle of his eye formation. However he talked very clear and forward despite the ugly looking appearance.<br>
  “Who are you, man? We know about the star land people. But we have never seen a star land person look like you before. You seem to be their species from our tests but you don’t look like them entirely.”<br>
  The man took his hand which had 10 webbed fingers on one hand and easily wrapped them around High Crawl’s throat.<br>
  “Tell me what you are doing here!”<br>
  Sam finally noticed he was being interrogated. “Wait! Stop! It’s me that sent her here I’m just trying to get home.”  <br>
     “Home? Explain.”<br>
  “Well, I’m not from here, this world. I seem to have been placed here for some unknown reason. And now I’m lost, I’m not sure how to get back home, my world.”<br>
  The steel plated aqua man walked towards Sam. Then he suddenly stopped, looking at Sam with all 4 of his eyes wide open. <br>
  “Wait…… you……..I know what you are.”<br>
  Sam starred back startled, not knowing what he meant by the statement.<br>
  “Me? You know, where my world is.”<br>
  The aqua man walked past Sam now tuning his gaze towards the stone window next to his bead. He stood there just looking out into the bleak sky. High Crawl, was on the ground looking at Sam in confusion.<br>
  “Yes, you are Empire.”<br>
  High Crawl gave out a chuckle while on the ground, now grabbing to get up.<br> 
  “You must be mistaken, star set man; he’s lost. He is definitely not Empire. <br>
  Sam pulled himself up in his bead. <br>
  “Who is the Empire? Can they take me home?”<br>
  The aqua man turned around and looked at Sam.<br>
  “They built this world, and probably yours too. We have only seen them a handful of times. They left this place a long time ago. You are not from this world, so they must have put you hear if you don’t know where you are now. The only question is why.”<br>
  Sam looked at the creature of a man in a form of desperation.<br>
  “Can you please help me?”<br>
  “I’m sorry but you must travel some more, in fact all the way to globe city.”<br>
  High Crawl made a loud incoherent noise on the ground, still trying to stand up.<br>
  “Myth! There is no such city.”<br>
  “You are wrong, star land woman, it exists where the star doesn’t. We even trade with them on occasions, by giving them the head of our monsters.”<br>
  Sam stood up and walked around the room. Then looked out the window where the creature man was looking. <br>
  “O.K. where is this monster?”<br><br><br>
  There was barely any light in star set land. Sam was guided only by torches held up on long poles. They were also navigating along a slippery rocky outcrop, which made up the entire land. The structures they built here were of cast iron and protrude from the rocky outcrops. <br>
  They gave Sam a steel crossbow with lead bolts. The crossbow was the size of Sam, but had a mechanical loading mechanism. All of the star set men had crossbows the same size as them.<br> 
   They went out into the night, it was very cold in star set land. High Crawl had given Sam a lot of clothing for the cold journey. It was full clothing made out of giant spider hair. It kept Sam warm enough not to freeze. <br>
  Sam and his team climbed up the rocky hillside, which made up the entire land. On top of one very large boulder was a stone torch about 50 feet high, it was burning fast with a light blue hue on top. It lit up the area around us so that we could see clearly, just like a street light in a dark alleyway. <br>
  Suddenly Sam herd rocks crushing under the weight of something massive. He panicked and jumped forward, holding tight to his crossbow. When on the ground he twisted to look at the monster. It was a dark green with scales as big as a man. The head alone was the size of a house, the body seemed endless as it disappeared into the darkness past the torch. Sam realized there was bolts being launched from every direction behind him and going to the monster. <br>
  High Crawl dragged Sam like a rag doll over to the safety of the team.<br>
  “keep firing,” one of the Star Set men was shouting, standing in front of Sam to symbolize taking charge as he launched bolts at the monster.<br>  
  There was a deep chilling scream, like screeching tires on a car. It seemed so alien, in then the monster slowly fell over hitting the rocks and creating a mini shockwave as Sam fell once again.  <br><br><br>       
    On the open sea again. This time on a large sailing ship carrying the head of a dragon on the deck. The ship was 300 feet long and the head took up the entire deck. There was lights everywhere on the ship, and Sam couldn’t see the sun anywhere.<br>
  “Um…. Excuse me Star Set man.” A Star Set man turns from working on the sail to address Sam.<br>
  “What is it?”<br>
  “Where is the……….uh……..star?”<br>
  “Behind us, were in the dark isle. Between the star and the globe city.”<br>
  Sam looked up to the pitch black sky. The sky alone was enough to freak him out. He had never realized until now, that with no light there truly is nothing. <br>
  “Wow, amazing there is no place on Earth with such……………empty.”<br>
  “You, see that glow in the distance.”<br>
  Sam peered over the tip of the ship on its edge.<br>
  “Yes, it’s faint but I see something.”<br>
  “Well that’s globe city. It’s still very, very far away. But don’t worry we will reach it now that we have located it. You should get some rest below deck.”<br><br><br>  
‘As Sam was sitting below deck, he realized that this whole time being in Vast Score he had never known what time it was. He slowly drifted off to sleep.’<br>
  “Wake up, were here.” High Crawl was at the foot of Sam’s bed, looking very anxious. She has obviously been very scared about arriving at this place.<br>
  “What’s the matter High Crawl?”<br>
  “Well. I thought this place was a myth. Now that it’s true, it seems our worst fears have been revealed. This place has much pain in it.”<br>
  Sam was about to respond when a sun set man came below deck with the strangest creature he had ever seen. His brain needed time to process what he was looking at, then he eventually re-buffed and established video again. It was what was familiar to him as a giant man sized two headed goldfish with 10 arms and 10 legs, it had a strange looking suit on that seemed to move and look like water and the two heads seemed to just lay at the side completely incoherent like the creature was truly a sleep walking fish. But it spoke very fluently and with very high intelligence.<br>
  “Hello there, Mr. Sam is it? We have much to discuss. I do appreciate your ritual gift from the bright lands beyond the horizon, thank you.”<br>
  “I……..uh………hello there.” Sam gathered himself up and remembered his mission. ”You see I am lost, I’m not from Vast Score. I’m from a place called Earth, and I’m trying to get back.”<br>
  The Star Set creature pointed at Sam with authority. “You see Globe City Man, I told you, I didn’t lie.”<br>
  One of the fishes head’s became animated like it was coming alive. The head moved toward Sam and looked at Sam with the dead lock look of a painting. It was suck a concentrated stare that it made Sam gasp at first.<br>
  “Don’t worry Sam, just analyzing. Incredible, he speaks the truth. Sam, I feel like I can help you. Would you like to enter my office, we have much to discuss.” <br><br><br>
  Globe city was a marvel on top of a marvel. It was a spire that was the size of a small continent. The Structure seemed to be made out of strong steel. It was like a fracture in the sky, Sam had never thought something so vast can exist. It made the Great Wall of China look like a backyard fence. And the whole thing had a bottom reaching the ocean floor where it was even bigger. <br>
  Sam was brought to an office area with the Globe City man in the part of the spire above the water by about a mile, where you could barely see the water bellow anymore. <br>
  The room was eerily quiet as Sam sat in a seat made out of some type of marble. The room he was in was made out of marble, granite and pearls. It seemed to sparkle from the artificial lightening inside the room. The light inside the structure was very bright and needed some getting used to. It was obvious how the entire spire from the outside was lit as a white glow where there was no sun or stars nearby. <br> 
  Sam realized what the Globe City people looked like once they were in the light. They wore midnight black colored hoodies. One of them in the room took off their hoodie and Sam gasped when he saw their true from. Like out of a horror movie they had the head of a fish. Their bodies however looked very human, even having human looking skin instead of scales.<br>        
  Their eyes were a bright yellow, and almost seemed like they were glowing. There was 12 of them standing in the room. Without there hoodies on they looked like a bunch of naked people with strange masks on to hide their identity, but that was in fact their face.<br>
  They looked so frail and delicate. One of them walked towards Sam, the Globe City people were slightly smaller than Sam; however Sam noticed that they must be a lot weaker noticing they had stick thin limbs and bodies. <br>
  Sam was unsure what to do as the alien looking creature came closer. Now 10 feet away Sam noticed that the body was actually 100% human like him. Sam quickly looked over to High Crawl who was behind Sam looking shocked. Her massive body was twice the size of Sam’s with elongated ribs and feet that made her look like the monster now.<br>
  Not knowing what to do Sam told the person who he now knew was obviously some kind of human female to stop. But she just kept on walking, in then Sam almost fell back when she took her head off. However it was what was under the now knowing mask that truly shocked him, a human female. <br>
  “What? Who are you?”<br>
  “Me? Who are you? And why do you look like us, yet come from the star lands.”<br>
  “I don’t know how I got here, that’s the truth.”<br>
  The light skinned, light haired woman starred at Sam looking at him like he had a secret and wasn’t telling anyone.<br>
  She walked back to her crew which Sam knew were all humans. As he looked he noticed all hoodies were of different sizes and shaped, probably males and females Sam assumed.<br>
  She walked back to Sam, still naked unknown to Sam.<br>
  Before she could speak Sam cut her off, “Why are you naked if you’re human?” <br>
   It was like Sam said the secret word. Everyone in the room gasped, including High Crawl who was now looking at Sam in complete shock.<br>
  The naked woman spoke in amazement, “You know that word………..hu……….human.” she trembled as she spoke, like there might be an earthquake if she said it too loud.<br>
   Sam spoke as if it was no big deal, ”Yea, I’m human and so are you and High Crawl too, I think.” Sam looked over at High Crawl and realized she really looked nothing like everyone else in the room, with giant ribs and protruding features, she looked more like a skeleton monster, but Sam wouldn’t think about leaving her; she was her only friend and the only person who stuck with Sam.<br>
  “Well yes, she is of hu……human lineage. But she isn’t Extrovene like you and me, she’s from the star lands.”<br>
  High Crawl came forward like a large creature into the scene. “Look, he’s lost. He doesn’t know how he got here. He appeared in star land not knowing how he got there. Then he braved the journey to star set. In then again to here, the myth city. Star Set person said he was Empire and that they built this place, what does that mean, and can he get home from whatever that is?”<br>
  The lady looked confused by the last part of the statement. “Empire?..............Well, Extrovene has roots to the word Tolium, which has very ancient words that are pronounced Eumpurie.” <br>
     “So you can take him home?”<br>
  “I’m sorry I don……………(Sam spoke out) “I’m from Earth! Earth OK!” from.”” She looked at Sam as if she now realized something.<br>
  “Earth? That’s impossible you can’t be from Earth.”<br>
  “Why can’t I?”<br>
  “Well because this is Earth.”<br>
  Sam looked surprised by the answer and unsure how to proceed.<br>
  “Well, I’m from another Earth then, check your spaceship navigator or planet finder, or whatever just get me home already.” Sam was getting tired of this long directionless journey, while assuming they had any of those things and knew what he was talking about.<br>
  “…………I assume you mean the celestial levels. The stars in the sky fell eons ago. There is nothing up there, literally nothing. The star, or as it was once called a very, very long time ago start, or maybe strong, well the word was…….(Sam spoke out)”Sun it was called Sun. And you’re saying that I’m from the past and not only that but eons ago?” Well that’s just the facts. The Earth has also stopped rotating as well as everything else in the celestial levels that was about an eon ago. Which is, let me see……………about 10 billion cycles around the sun.”<br><br><br>
“10 BILLION YEARS!!!!!”  <br>
  Everything around Sam started to intensify, the light the sounds. He didn’t realize it but he was falling backwards in then nothing.<br><br><br>
  When he woke up he was in the same room again. He found that woman again sitting in a marble bench holding a lot of books and large capsules of some kind. High Crawl was sitting next to her reading one of the books.<br>
  The woman stood up when she saw Sam start to sit up, “Oh, good you’re awake. No don’t get up, stay there.”<br>
  She brought a seat over to Sam, everything was made of marble but was as light as a feather. She grabbed all of her stuff and plopped all in Sam’s lap. Sam looked up confused, but knew he had to say something and ask some serious questions. The woman just continued to look curious throughout everything that had happened.<br>
  “I want to know why I look like you, but I’m not from this time.”<br>
  The woman calmly opened a book to a book mark and plugged it into a capsule, Sam assumed the data was somehow transferred to the book digitally. But the machine was actually a translator that translated what the book said directly to a neuro link in the brain.<br>
  “Yes, here it is. You are from the 5th age. It was the age just before the empire split from the rest of the humone genetic line.”<br>
  “Human? What are you saying? And why are you afraid to say human? In addition why are you naked?”<br>
  “Well we are a humanoid. You see there are 4 other humanoids besides us on Earth. In fact there always have been. It’s just in the past we all looked the same and were called that word that we are all afraid to say, because it brings back stories of terrible wars that occurred in the later ages…………. I’m naked because it is how an Extrovene greets another to show they are carrying no weapons and are showing vulnerability towards another. Our masks and hoods are to protect what we look like from other humanoids, and that’s really just the sun set People who we trade with for their monster heads which we use for decoration in exchange for knowledge of the other humanoids. The other 2 are actually way past star land and into a strange location where there is no star or anything, just a place where everything glows. They look like small creatures with pointy ears and the other looks just like a small creature with lots of hair.”<br>
  “An elf and a dwarf?”<br>
  “What’s that?……I don’t know what they are, but between the two of them they have a lot of knowledge about the past.” <br>
  “How do you know that?”<br>
  “All of these books are their documentations of what happened in the past”<br>
  “Can I meet them? Maybe they can help me.”<br>
  “Well………………..sure if you really want to. I mean it’s a strange land and they are also terrified of Extrovenes.”<br>
  “I think it might be my only chance to at least get some answers.”<br>
  “OK then, here put on the hood and mask; otherwise they won’t even come near you.” <br><br><br>
    Entering beyond the outer star land and into a dark land where the land begins to slightly glow. There is no more water, just a vast glowing dessert.<br>
  Sam is flying to the strange land in a machine about the size of a house but makes no sound whatsoever, just the sound of the wind blowing past it. It’s shaped like an oval and it’s made out of a plastic rubber. The inside is completely hallow with almost nothing in it except some seating around a small dimly lit control panel in the center of the vast space. It was like a candle lit gym, if the candles were just in one spot.<br>
  ‘This is so alien, I can’t believe were actually flying in this thing.’<br>
  Sam spoke up as he and High Crawl sat speechless in a marble couch while the woman was working the controls. “So…. Uh………what’s your name? I mean you helped me out so much.”<br>
  The woman just kept working the controls but spoke as if her work was just reading the newspaper, “it’s Reshka, and High Crawl told me your name is Sam.”<br>
  “So can you…………”<br>
  “Were here, make sure you don’t take off the costume or else you won’t get any answers from them.”<br>
  In an instant the ship vanished like a cloud of smoke and there was just the control panel sitting on the sandy land still lit up. Sam walked around outside the area a little bit to observe his surroundings. The whole land was glowing, so you could see but the sky was pitch black. It was like walking on a giant glow stick in the dark. Sam went to pick up some of the glowing sand.<br>
  “NOOOOOOOO!!!!!! Don’t touch that!” screamed Reshka.<br>
  “Why, what is it?”<br>
  “It’s radiated sand from nuclear waste.”<br>
  “But were walking on it.”<br>
  “No, were still inside the ship, it’s just transparent on the ground. But if you go down to touch something the ship were recognize your intensions and let you pass.”<br>
  “Oh………so where are the 2 other humanoids?”<br>
  “I have a signature coming this way. It’s one of the pointy ear ones.”<br>
  Sam looked out in the distance to see a figure approaching from the glowing sand. As the figure got closer it looked more and more like a tiny 2 foot tall story book elf. Except as it got closer Sam noticed that it was no story book elf. The figure had no face, it was just pointy ears and a head that was shaped like an elf.<br>
  Then 3 other figures came looking just like dwarves but again no face just ears. They met the elf figure and communicated by using their hands to clap, snap and various other quick noises with their hands that it almost sounded like speech.<br>
Sam was interrupted from his examination by Reshka, “here put this on so you can hear them and your brain can interpret them. Were outside the range of globe city web translator.” Reshka put a halo device on his head. When she did the device lit up and Sam suddenly heard the figures speaking to him from outside the invisible ship. <br>
  The pointy ear figure spoke while moving its hands. “We know your empire you know. Those costumes don’t fool us. They don’t fool anyone.”<br>
  “Hi,” Sam decided it was now or never to get some answers. “Can I take this off then I…….”<br>
  “NO!!!!!! Please keep it on, it would lead to, too much fear if you took them off please don’t.”<br>
  Sam looked out at them to try and gauge the emotional environment. “I’m just hear with my friends we don’t mean anyone any harm, I’ve just come to ask some questions.”<br>
  One of the hairy ones spoke,” An Empire that has a question for us?”<br>
“Yes,” Sam decided to cut to the chase. “You see I seem to have fallen out of time. I don’t belong at this time, I’m from the………..5th age.”<br>
  The pointy ear one spoke, “you mean you’re really from the 5th age, so long ago when we all looked the same and were the same species?”<br>
  Sam followed through, “Yes I really am. And I don’t know how I got here.”<br>
  The hairy one spoke to his friends beside him while laughing, all without a face; “well if that’s true then he might not even be empire.”<br>
  The pointy ear one spoke with a serious tone, “stop, what if it’s true. He could be the Relic Rosetta from the prophesy.”<br>
  The hairy one still laughing snickered,” what him? Look at him, he’s too confused. He probably doesn’t know what that is.”<br>
  Sam wondered how someone without a face could look. He decided to test the situation. “Well I know what the Rosetta stone is, it’s a stone that translates ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics from Ancient Greek.”<br>
  The beings looked stunned, including Reshka and High Crawl who were now sitting listening to Sam intently. <br>
  Reshka spoke while in her costume which electronically slightly dissipated her voice, as it did Sam’s. “Who are you?”<br>
  Sam spun around, “What, I’m telling the truth. I really am from that time and I really don’t know how I got here.”<br>
  The hairy being spoke no longer laughing, “The mystery of the Rosetta stone is much more ancient than the Relic Rosetta and no one would know about that, not even empire.<br>
  Sam turned around again. ”So you know I’m telling the truth now. Do you know how I got here? And if I can get back to my time?”<br>
  The pointy ear one spoke, ”What ‘s the last thing you remember before coming here.”<br>
  Sam thought hard about that time which seemed like ages ago. “I was……………..getting on a train to visit my family. I remembered I stepped on the train……………In then…………….I felt like I was hit with a bat in then I woke up and here I am.”<br>   
    The pointy ear one spoke, “When did you first realize you were somewhere else?”<br>
  Sam looked out at the creature with the first glimmer of hope in a while since arriving at Vast Score. “It was moments afterwards. I found myself on the sandy ground of star land. Then that’s when I found High Crawl and my adventure went from there.”<br>
  The pointy ear one looked as if he spotted something was wrong, if that was possible without a face. “Did you say moments afterward?”<br>
  “Yes, it was moments. I was there and now I’m here.”<br>
  “Well that seems to me that it couldn’t be anything related to 8th age empire technology. Anything that could have jumped someone into another realm couldn’t have done it in an instant in fact it would have felt like a lifetime to make the jump.”<br>
  “So are you saying you can jump me back?”<br>
  “Oh no, we don’t have any technology at all actually. We just know what the empire used to have. The empire doesn’t because they burned their history to forget what they did to their own species.”<br>
  Sam decided to take the detour, “what exactly happened after the 5th age?”<br>
  “Well.”<br>
  Reshka shifted in her seat, “I can’t listen to this. If I hear it I will have to be questioned and they wou…………”<br>
  The pointy ear one interjected, “No, I don’t care you are listening to it. And all of it. What they did was quite simply a destruction of our species. At the end of the 5th age when we achieved the high end of digital technology the empire realized through a matrix equation that there are different creatures within our own species. That they could be separated and be made to change into something new. So they did just that using a serum that helped evolve them along at the speed of light. Well it didn’t take long until they changed themselves and the others to looking like they do now.  But there’s more, we don’t die or reproduce, the mutations somehow made it so that we are permanently like we are. Except for the empire who can die and reproduce. They also advanced in technology and became more and more power hungry. In the end they used their technology to stop the Earth from spinning, stop the sun from moving, burn out all of the stars, terraform the Earth so that the other beings were far outside the reach of Globe City and wipe the memory of every empire person so they would never know where they came from.”<br>
  Sam picked up on a key part of the story, “So the empire stopped the Sun and the Earth?”<br>
  “Yes, they stopped it all so that they could live apart from the rest of the beings.”<br>
  “How long ago was this?”<br>
  “About 800 years ago.”<br>
  “So you’re saying I’m only roughly 800 years into the future?”<br>
  “Well, by the looks of you, yes.”<br>
  Reshka stood up franticly moving the controls, “ok that’s enough, it’s time to go.”<br>
   And with that the ship went black again except for the candle lit control panel. And before Sam knew it he was already on his way back to Globe City.<br>
  “Stop, what are you doing, the being was leading me back home.”<br>
  Reshka spoke keeping glued to the panel, “no, the being was just giving us classified information that I could be wiped clean for knowing. They are going to de-brief me now and I need to tell them what I heard.”<br>
  “I don’t care, just drop me off there then.”<br>
   “I can’t, then they will question why I left you there.”<br>
   They arrived inside Globe City just like that and walked onto a sky dock. It was lit up with bright lights and it was overlooking the vast see.<br>
  Sam looked at High Crawl who was looking at Reshka who was looking at the sea bellow.<br>
  High Crawl told Reshka, “How will he ever get home Reshka?”<br>
  Reshka looked annoyed now from all of the activity of the day. “Here,” she looked away from the sea and removed the halo from Sam. She took out a steel necklace from underneath the control panel and put it on Sam, then went back to the control panel.<br>
  “Now I will be able to tell what you are, which one of the 5 you are.” Reshka was still looking at the panel, except now she looked like she had seen a ghost.<br>
  “What is it Reshka?” Sam yelled.<br>
“It says you’re an Extrovene, one of us. But how could you have survived this long? You must have jumped from somewhere.”<br>
    Just then 3 other empire persons walked in with strange looking staffs that had a metal looking claw at the end with a glowing violet ball inside of it. They stormed in and one of them pointed their staff toward Reshka and the ball grew brighter and brighter.<br>
  Reshka panicked and fell to the floor in fear covering her face, “Wait you can’t wipe me! Not before we are able to find out who Sam is.<br>
  The one pointing the staff talked with a very low, calm and clear tone, “We heard everything, you were being spied on by the intelligence committee. We had to make sure our way of life stays preserved. Sorry but you’re not being wiped, your being exterminated.”<br>
  With that the ball grew brighter and emitted a static sound like from a radio. Then an electric arc leaped out of the ball like an expanding rainbow, only it was only violet and blazing hot. In an instant High Crawl jumped on top of Reshka who was on the ground hiding her face. The arc caught High Crawl in midair just as she was about to land on Reshka. When it touched her body she became violet to the point where she was the ball of light in her from, in then the light was gone, the ball and so was High Crawl.<br>
  Sam was staring at where High Crawl was, and where Reshka was still hiding her face, “What………WHERE IS SHE?!!!!!!!!!”<br>
  The one with the staff looked like he was panicking, he drew his staff back and addressed Sam. “I have exterminated a non-Extroverne. What I have done is un-excusable.” The others chanted, “un-excusable.” “I have broken the highest law, now I must be exterminated myself.” The staff’s ball arced again engulfing itself and the person holding it, in then they were both gone.<br>
  Sam decided it was now or be killed later. He rushed towards the staff lying on the ground, and snatched it before anyone could come back from the events that had just unfolded. One of the staff people noticed Sam holding the staff. Sam pointed it and the ball seemed to do the rest, the other man vanished.<br>
  The last man was still pre-occupied with what to do with Reshka as he stood hovering over her. Sam quickly pointed the staff, then the last one was gone.<br>
     
  “Stand up Reshka, now that you know the truth about Globe City can you take me anywhere, where there is information about Earth in the past?”<br>
  Reshka looked at Sam with great fear, not knowing his intentions after clearing the room of the sentinels. “We must get back to the ship immediately.”<br>
  Reshka went back to the control panel in front of her, then everything went black. <br><br><br> 
      The ship went invisible again, and they were on top of a huge raise in elevation somewhere in the outer star lands. All Sam could see was clouds beneath him.<br>
  “Where are we?” Sam asked.<br>
  “Were in a dead spot, from the Cloud City radar tip………… If they find us…………we will be tortured for cycles in then killed for the crimes we have committed.”<br>
  Sam looked out at the clouds, “……..What if I fall to my death in this time?”<br>
  Reshka spun around and looked at Sam wondering what his intentions were. “What do you mean Sam? You’ll die, in this time.”<br>
  “Well, I would die here. But maybe I still exist in the past and I would suddenly be conscious in the past.”<br>
  “I won’t let you kill yourself after all we have been through, not going to happen.” <br>
  “Why, what’s the point. Were doomed anyway. Plus if I die here then you will be seen as the hero.”<br>
  Reshka seemed to be pondering about whether or not her death sentence could change. All of a sudden it started pouring rain. The water droplets went around an invisible round exterior that was the ship. It looked like a water fountain with an overhead spout. “They know where we are Sam, they use the rain as a radar to sense objects. Cloud City controls the weather in Vast Score and now they are going to kill us.”<br>
  Sam looked out at the clouds again, “No, they’ll never find me!” And with that Sam took a leap out of the ship and into the pouring rain as he fell with the rain drops. <br>
    He couldn’t hear anything but the rain as he was falling. He eventually left the clouds and he could see the sandy ground. It was in the distance but fast approaching. Then all of a sudden he was stopped and everything went black with the candlelit control panel in the middle. Reshka had scooped him up with ease using the ship.<br>
  She left the control panel and turned to Sam, “I think I figured out how to bring you home. But you have to trust me. We must bring you back to Globe City, there is a panel in the sky scrape room that can jump you back to your time.”<br>
  Sam looked at Reshka very angry, “are you telling me you people had a time machine this whole time?”<br>
  “Well it’s complicated. It only works on people who are targeted from the past to here. So for example it won’t work on me.”<br>
  “So, why am I being targeted?”<br>
  “”I’m not sure, but there’s little time to waste. If whoever is targeting you cuts the life line thus killing you in the past then you can never go back.”<br>
  “Fine, just bring me back home.” <br><br><br>
      Reshka while keeping the ship invisible launched the ship full throttle to the top of Cloud City. Sam was astonished at just how big the tower really was. Shaped like a giant spire it seemed like it was entering outer space. In then it was, the top was just outside of Earth itself; like a space station being held up by the Earth itself but it was a manmade structure. <br>
  “How is it possible to build something like this?”<br>
   “For an Extrovene it’s just a part of life. ”As Reshka said that she entered the space dock and told Sam to move quickly.<br>
      They ran into the control room next to the dock and Sam vaporized the 5 people in it with the staff. Reshka worked the controls furiously.<br>
  “Wow, have you used this before.”<br>
  “Yes, all Extrovenes have. Were required to visit the past as part of our education.”<br>
  “But you were told a lie.”<br>
  “Yes, I know that now. They must have brainwashed the people we brought to the future. There it’s all set………..”<br>
   “What’s the matter Reshka?”<br>
  “It was targeting…………..me.”<br>
  Sam looked at Reshka like she was telling a joke while still on edge of people who might be entering the room, “That must be a mistake, that’s impossible.”<br>
  In an instant her mood changed from frantic to sober. Sam noticed her expression and started to become less frantic too.<br>
  “Sam, I was part of an experiment. I’m not even an Extroverne, you are. They swapped us both you went to the past and I as one of the humanoids but as a human to the future. They sent you back here to replace me, I guess they were done with me. And one of us has to die, the experimental time serum has almost run out. Or else we both die in exactly……………oh my………..40 minutes!”<br>
  Sam didn’t believe anything she said, “that’s non-sense, they’re lying. Just get me back home.” <br>
  “Sam, you are home. And those are probably your colleagues you killed. And now one of us must die……………. Sam I saved you, I don’t know how you’ll take this news but please remember that.”<br>
  Sam then pointed the staff towards Reshka and a look of absolute terror and confusion fell on her face. “What?!!!! You knew??????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”<br>
  Sam just smiled which further terrified Reshka, “of course they briefed me when I came back. I acted my way over here and the whole time to get information about the past and how the other humanoids behave compared to us.”<br>
  Reshka fell to the ground and covered her face, crying in terror.<br>
  “You humanoids are all the same Reshka, even you as a human. Scared and easily manipulated. This staff is just a teleporter and you actually think that this massive glorious city would just let you in and out of it just like that. This place has security that you would never understand.”<br>
  “Sam……… I was just trying to help.”<br>
  “Oh yes, always trying to help.” Sam twisted the bottom of the staff and the ball of light changed from purple to black.<br>
  “You know, Reshka. It’s not at all that I hate you humanoids. It’s just that were too different, and that causes problems.”<br>
  “Sam, please don’t do this. You don’t have to kill me.”<br>
  “well, actually I do.”<br>
  To Sam’s surprise Reshka stood up and looked Sam in the eyes. She moved the staff’s light ball towards her chest while sobbing.<br>
  “Unlike you Sam, we humanoids don’t find pleasure in living a life in a lie. You people don’t know what being human is, even if you look human…………… What are you waiting for?”<br>
  For the first time not acting, Sam looked generally concerned. “You mean, you’re not scared to die?”<br>
  Reshka looked up still sobbing, “No, not if nothing was real. And everything I know was a lie to pull information from me. I would rather die.”<br>
  To Reshka’s complete and absolute surprise, Sam turned the staff so that the black ball was pointed at his chest. “Then I have failed……………You win Reshka you can go back to your family in the past………….When we rose up from the rest of the humanoids those few centuries ago, we all knew that none of us were afraid to die for the cause. We thought that was what made us different, our willingness to die for a greater cause. But you would die over a lie? I can’t say we would do that. I have failed to prove that humanoids would never die for something that they believe in. In your case the thought that the life you lived isn’t worth living. Well I think you’ll find your new life much better with the real Sam.”<br>
  Sam pulled a knob out from the control panel and put it in in another spot on the control panel, then turned it. “Goodbye, Rachel. And…………..I’m sorry.” <br><br><br>
    Reshka woke up in a hospital bed. It was a bright morning with the sun illuminating the room. There was a man sitting next to her with his hands on his face sobbing. As Reshka moved a little more the man pulled his hands away from his face and looked at Reshka in pure joy.<br>
  Reshka looked back in terror, it was Sam. However when she looked back she noticed that there was something different about this Sam. The look in his eyes were not of any strong determined look, just joy.<br>
  “Rachel!!!! You’re awake. Oh honey, I love you so much. I didn’t think you would ever wake up again after that accident.”<br>
  Reshka (AKA) Racheal sat up and smiled. Knowing that she wasn’t afraid to die for what she loved. And what she truly loved was to be loved. The Extrovene had failed to bring her down to fear even the person that she loved. So somewhere in Cloud City there is a Sam with a whole in his chest and a frown on his face. <br>
